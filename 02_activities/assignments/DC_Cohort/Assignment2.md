## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (type 1)→ overwrite changes in costumer's address record, no history is retained
columns: custumer_id; customer_first_name; cutomer_last_name; customer_current_address
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (type 2)→ does not overwrite changes in costumer's address record, address history is retained by adding another two columns
columns: custumer_id; customer_first_name; cutomer_last_name; customer_address; address_start_date; address_end_date
```

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first column with nulls, and 'unit' for the second column with nulls. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customer’s visits to the farmer’s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customer’s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customer’s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customer’s most recent visit.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

2. Filter the query to show any product_size value that contain a number with REGEXP. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

Recently, in one of the advanced qualitative methods classes I took, my colleagues and I had a very engaging discussion about the new AI features inserted into qualitative software programs such as NVivo and Dedoose. These features are supposed to ease the tedious line-by-line coding in methods such as Grounded Theory, save at least the initial coding stage, and help research teams "do more!" - analyze a larger volume of qualitative data excerpts in less time. Reading Boykis's article, I was thinking about how easily we give up the skills we have been working to develop for so long. For decades, qualitative researchers have developed strategies to turn qualitative inquiry into a more rigorous process through methods such as collaborative coding and member checking, while also maintaining the unique perspectives of the researcher and research participants and accounting for the specifics of the context in which data were collected and generated. After reading Boykis's move in the article, I was curious to understand how these qualitative software and new AI features actually work. Visiting Nvivo website, I have discovered that Nvivo-15's Lumivero AI Assistant automates the coding process in three stages: (1) learning the researcher coding patterns based on a bulk of previous intial excerpts done by the researcher; (2) sending the excerpts to a third-party services such as Geminei or OpenAI GPT for processing them (with a commitment that interview's data it is not used to train the AI model); and (3) generating predictions to code the following qualitative excerpts (e.g., interviews/policy documents/focus-groups). As someone with extensive experience in qualitative research, I could not help but think about the consequences of this coding streamlining process. Qualitative research was developed to understand local, context-dependent social processes that can't be "captured" by quantitative methods and statistics. Statistical inference requires a sample with a limited amount of variance to draw statistically significant results (this variance should be above zero but not too large, depending on the size of the sample) and then to generalize to an imagined homogeneous group (i.e., population). In contrast, qualitative research values diverse and contradictory perspectives within the same sample, which is then the work of the researcher, using social theory and other materials to interpret the diversity of perspectives and experiences, showing how they can dwell in the same context, while illuminating and representing the experiences of those who are absent. In this regard, I am afraid that the mechanism used by NVivo 15 will quantify qualitative research, through the decontextualization of data and its comparison to an "average" perspective/experience produced by Geminei/ChatGPT, and by doing so, it will undermine the goal and rationale bringing us to develop qualitative research in the first place. It is worth emphasizing that I have nothing against quantitative research and often use it to answer specific questions. However, quantitative methodology cannot answer all questions. It cannot, for example, adequately capture the diverse perspectives and experiences of marginalized individuals and communities. It also fails to represent both the depth and breadth of viewpoints that are often overlooked due to "publication/dissemination bias" (i.e., the tendency for research studies with positive or statistically significant results to be published more frequently than those with negative, null, or inconclusive findings). Thus, the motivation for incorporating these AI tools seems to be not just to improve them. Here, it is time to return to the "doing more" celebrated in one of NVivo-15's AI-feature promotions. In the ultra-productionist academic culture, social sciences are immersed in the imperative to "do more" (produce more articles, based on a larger amount of data), which becomes the only criterion to evaluate both researchers and research. I am afraid that an unreflexive adoption of these recent "innovative" features in qualitative research will undermine our ability to learn from neglected perspectives and will also influence qualitative research to reproduce and echo the "average perspective", which is, unfortunately, biased towards those who have already been extensively represented in the public digital sphere.
